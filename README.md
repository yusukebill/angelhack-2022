**Project Name:** 

Karashi

**Pitch:**

GameFi NFT aggregator on Avalanche

**Description:** 

**Summary of the project**: Karashi is a NFT aggregator on Avalanche where users can search and discover their favorite GameFi NFTs across marketplaces such as NFTrade, Joepegs, Element Market. 

**The problem**: The liquidity of NFTs on Avalanche is fragmented across marketplaces, making it harder for users to find and buy favorite NFTs at the cheapest price at once. There are more than 7 active NFT marketplaces. Snail Trail, for example, is currently actively traded on Kaleo, NFtrade, Joepegs, and Element Market. This type of fragmentation is happening to multiple NFT collections in the ecosystem mostly due to the explosion of GameFi projects. 

**Our approach**: Our solution is to create an NFT aggregator where users can search and compare their favorite collections across marketplaces so they donâ€™t have to go to each one of them to find them at the best price. Our solution helps users save time and money. We are covering 5 marketplaces now and plan to add more shortly.
